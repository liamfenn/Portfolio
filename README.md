# Colophon

Built with Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS 4, and TypeScript. The current homepage is set in ABC Oracle and ABC Otto. Deployed on Vercel.

Weather data from OpenWeatherMap. Now playing from the Spotify API. Designed and developed by Liam Fennell with assistance from Claude.

## Design tokens

Edit `src/app/tokens.css` to change the homepage's shared colors and typography.
Use these variables in component styles instead of adding raw color or type values.

- Colors: `--color-background`, `--color-foreground`, `--color-muted`,
  `--color-muted-foreground`, `--color-surface`, and named brand colors.
- Fonts: `--font-oracle` and `--font-otto` bind to the loaded font files.
- Primitive type values: 15px body text and 14px captions on desktop;
  14px body text and 13px captions on mobile; regular weight and family tracking.

Apply one class from `src/app/text-styles.css` to get the whole text style.
Colors remain independent so the same style can use primary or secondary text.

| Style class | Font | Desktop size / leading | Mobile size / leading |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text-bodySerif` | Otto | 15px / 20px | 14px / 18px |
| `text-bodySans` | Oracle | 15px / 20px | 14px / 18px |
| `text-captionSerif` | Otto | 14px / 19px | 13px / 18px |
| `text-captionSans` | Oracle | 14px / 19px | 13px / 18px |

These are the four named styles, including the palette lab and inspector UI.
All use weight 400. Serif styles track at -2%; sans styles track at -1%.
Change a named style's `--type-*` bundle to update its family, size, weight,
and leading together. Email and social links use bodySerif. Project details,
project dates, and the player's listening status and time use captionSans.

The built-in inspector works on the homepage and the palette lab:

- **T** cycles content → text style → font size / line height in pixels → content.
- **C** cycles content → color token → hex → content.
- **Escape** restores content. Switching from T to C (or vice versa) starts
  at that family's token view. Shortcuts ignore editable fields and modifier keys.

Use `InspectableText` for new visible text, inside its text-style class. Its
original React content stays mounted, and transitions share the filters' glyph
effect. Pair text color declarations with `--inspect-color-token: color-name`
so the inspector reports the semantic token; unmatched colors show `unassigned`.
The inspector reads rendered font metrics and color values at the current width.
Labels retain the original text styling without added backgrounds or swatches.
The intro is inspected as one paragraph, using its shared bodySerif style and base color.

Project badge colors reference these same tokens in `src/lib/project-previews.ts`.
The user-selected glitch colors and settings remain in `src/lib/palette-toy.ts`;
they are independent of the UI colors and retain saved palette preferences.

## Spotify authorization

Spotify development-mode refresh tokens expire after 180 days. To reconnect the
music widget, make sure the redirect URI in `.env.local` is registered in the
Spotify developer dashboard, then run:

```bash
npm run spotify:authorize
```

Open the printed authorization URL. After approval, the local callback updates
`SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN` in `.env.local` without printing it. Rotate the matching
Production environment variable in Vercel and redeploy the current release.
